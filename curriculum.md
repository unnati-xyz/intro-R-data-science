# Curriculum

The broad curriculum elements for the workshop are listed below. We would showcase **some of them** in this workshop.

1. **Introduction** - “I think, therefore I am”
  - What is data analysis?
  - What type of questions can be answered?
  - Frame/Acquire/Refine/Explore/Model/Insight framework

2. **Acquire** - "Data is the new oil"
  - Sources of Data - Download from an internal system, Obtained from client, or other 3rd party, Extracted from a web-based API, Scraped from a website / pdfs, or Gathered manually and recorded
  - Acquire data from a csv file or a database
  - Acquire data from a 3rd part client (e.g. twitter)

3. **Refine** - "Data is messy"
  - Concept of Tidy Data - Why is it important?
  - Missing e.g. Check for missing or incomplete data
  - Quality e.g. Check for duplicates, accuracy, unusual data
  - Parse e.g. extract year from date
  - Merge e.g. first and surname for full name
  - Convert e.g. free text to coded value
  - Derive e.g. gender from title
  - Calculate e.g. percentages, proportion
  - Remove e.g. remove redundant data
  - Aggregate e.g. rollup by year, cluster by area
  - Filter e.g. exclude based on location
  - Sample e.g. extract a representative data
  - Summary e.g. show summary stats like mean
  - Basic statistics: variance, standard deviation, co-variance, correlation

4. **Explore** - "I don't know, what I don't know"
  - Why do visual exploration?
  - Understand Data Structure & Types
  - Explore single variable graphs - Quantitative, Categorical
  - Explore dual variable graphs - Q & Q, Q & C, C & C
  - Explore multi-dimensional variable graphs

5. **Model** - "All models are wrong, Some of them are useful"
  - Introduction to Machine Learning
  - The power and limits of models
  - Tradeoff between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability
  - Assessing Model Accuracy
    - For Regression problems - RMSE
    - For classification problems- Precision, Recall, AUC/ROC, F-Score, Mis-classification rate
  - Bias-Variance tradeoff
  - Overfitting
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Classification model
  - Decision Trees
  - Visualizing decision trees

6. **Insight** - “The goal is to turn data into insight”
  - Why do we need to communicate insight?
  - Types of communication - Exploration vs. Explanation
  - Explanation: Telling a story with data
  - Exploration: Building an interface for people to find stories
